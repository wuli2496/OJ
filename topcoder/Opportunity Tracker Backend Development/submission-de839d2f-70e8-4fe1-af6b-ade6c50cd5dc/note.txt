I did not prepare postman tests because it was not in scope.
If you want to test the endpoints with postman you have to provide valid access tokens for authorization.
If you want to bypass the authorization for testing purposes, i suggest this way:
- comment out line at `routes.js#36`: `authenticator(req, res, next)`
- add this line of code before `next()` statement to `routes.js#37`: req.authUser = { uid: '00uqmq050xZZfddgc5d6', username: 'emre.isbilir@gmail.com', scopes: ['openid'], jwtToken: 'eyJ' }
- final code block will be like this:
if (def.auth) {
        actions.push((req, res, next) => {
          // authenticator(req, res, next)
          req.authUser = { uid: '00uqmq050xZZfddgc5d6', username: 'emre.isbilir@gmail.com', scopes: ['openid'], jwtToken: 'eyJr' }
          next()
        })
